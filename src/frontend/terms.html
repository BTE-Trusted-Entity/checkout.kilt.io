      <section>
        <h3>1. Application and Scope of These Terms and Conditions</h3>
        <p>1.1. For the usage for Checkout Service these Terms and Conditions (“<strong>GTC</strong>”) shall apply. The
          Services are provided to you via software (the “<strong>Software</strong>” or “<strong>Checkout
            Service</strong>”) created and run by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH, Keithstraße 2-4, 10787 Berlin,
          Germany (hereinafter referred to as “BTE”, “us”, “we” or “our”). <a
            href="https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/checkout.kilt.io">The software is published and you are free
            to check out the code under https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/checkout.kilt.io.</a> The Terms and
          Conditions apply irrespective of whether you are a consumer, entrepreneur or merchant.</p>
        <p>1.2. The Checkout Service enables you to perform on-chain transactions on the KILT blockchain, e.g. to
          generate
          on-chain DIDs, to claim a web3name, etc. without using the necessary KILT Coins to pay the transaction costs
          including a potentially required deposit. Over time additional functionalities might follow for which similar
          terms are applicable.</p>
        <p>1.3. The version of the Terms and Conditions valid at the time of conclusion of the contract shall apply.</p>
        <p>1.4. We expressly object to the inclusion of general terms and conditions of contractual partners. This also
          applies if terms and conditions of the contractual partner are attached or referred to in contractual
          documents as well as if BTE performs or accepts services in the knowledge of conflicting or deviating terms
          and conditions of the contractual partner.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>2. Prerequisites for Using the Checkout Service</h3>
        <p>2.1. The Checkout Service is just one component in the usage of other technologies – it writes the
          transaction you
          prepared and signed on your device onto the KILT Blockchain and you will only have to pay our service fee for
          Checkout Service.</p>
        <p>2.2. The Checkout Service communicates with the KILT blockchain and depends on its functionality. Errors,
          dysfunctionalities, including failure of the KILT blockchain or the technical ecosystem in which it lives may
          adversely affect the Checkout Service functionalities.</p>
        <p>2.3. The preparation of transactions on the KILT blockchain and interaction with it is done directly through
          the
          wallet – the Sporran. <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">For more information about the Sporran, please go to
            this link: https://www.sporran.org/</a>
          Over time there might be other wallets also connecting to the service – in these cases, please check out their
          information and terms.</p>
        <p>2.4. In Sporran, you need to have an existing KILT address to which the information you want us to write unto
          the
          KILT Blockchain, e.g. Decentralized Identifier, your web3name, your credentials etc. can be
          attributed/linked.</p>
        <p>2.5. The Checkout Service is used through the Sporran wallet and depends on its functionality. Errors,
          dysfunctionalities, including failure of the Sporran or the technical ecosystem in which it lives may
          adversely affect the Checkout Service functionalities</p>
        <p>2.6. To make payment for the Checkout Service, you need a PayPal account with funds or otherwise connect your
          funds to PayPal. <a href="https://www.paypal.com">For more information on PayPal and their terms and
            conditions, etc., please go to this link: https://www.paypal.com</a> Over time, the Checkout Service might
          accept other means of payment as well – in these cases, please check out their information and terms.</p>
        <p>2.7. BTE shall not be liable for the availability or usability of the KILT Blockchain, Sporran and PayPal
          (Hereinafter “Third-Party Technologies”), which are necessary for the use of the Checkout Service. Users must
          contact Third-Party Technology providers directly regarding any issues.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>3. Process of the Checkout Service</h3>
        <p>3.1. Even if your blockchain transaction is being paid for by the Checkout Service, you have to prepare this
          transaction in Sporran and sign it there with your password to enable the Checkout Service to write your
          transaction on the KILT Blockchain on your behalf.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the functionality of the KILT Protocol is used that allows using a proxy account, where the
          account that prepares a transaction and the account that takes over the interaction with the KILT blockchain
          can differ. For using that functionality, you must prepare each separate transaction in the Sporran and hand
          it over to the Checkout Service for finalization onto the KILT blockchain. </p>
        <p>3.2. You do not need to give any further permissions, grant a general access to your account or disclose
          private
          keys or passwords to access your account to us.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>4. Conclusion of the Contract</h3>
        <p>If you chose to use our Checkout Service in order to write certain identifiers to KILT Blockchain, you will
          be connected to the Checkout Service website where you need to approve the payment with PayPal. Such payment
          will only be deducted if you finish the order process. You will have a chance to review the selected Checkout
          Service as well as the respective identifier and the total costs prior to ordering our Checkout Service. By
          selecting the “Chargeable Order” button a binding contract with B.T.E. regarding the Checkout Service is
          concluded and we will execute the transaction with the KILT Blockchain. </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>5. Payment, Extra Costs, VAT and Data from PayPal</h3>
        <p>5.1. The respective price stated in the Sporran includes all fees required for the transaction as well as
          VAT.</p>
        <p>5.2. When you use PayPal to pay us, PayPal will transfer the full amount in Euro to us. Should your account
          with
          PayPal contain other currencies, you might have extra costs on PayPal for exchanging your currencies to Euro.
          Any and all terms and conditions for the payment in PayPal is made through your contract with PayPal as a user
          and our contract with PayPal as a company.</p>

        <h3>7. Liability</h3>
        <p>7.1. Claims for damages are excluded. This limitation does not apply to claims for damages from injury to
          life,
          body, health or from the violation of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) as well as
          liability for other damages which are based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by BTE, its
          legal representatives or vicarious agents. Material contractual obligations are those whose fulfilment is
          necessary to achieve the objective of the contract.</p>
        <p>7.2. In the event of a breach of essential contractual obligations, BTE shall only be liable for the
          foreseeable
          damage typical for the contract if this was caused by simple negligence, unless it is a matter of claims for
          damages by the customer arising from injury to life, body or health.</p>
        <p>7.3. The restrictions of paragraphs 7.1. and 7.2. shall also apply in favor of the legal representatives and
          vicarious agents of BTE if claims are asserted directly against them.</p>
        <p>7.4. BTE shall not be liable for the availability or usability of other Third-Party Technologies necessary
          for the
          use of the Checkout Service. Users must contact Third Party Technology providers directly regarding any
          issues. You acknowledge and agree that we have no support, service level, or other obligations like these
          third-party technologies.</p>

        <h3>9. Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>9.1. These Terms and Conditions and the entire legal relationship between the parties shall be governed by
          the
          laws of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the
          International Sale of Goods (CISG). The statutory provisions on the restriction of the choice of law and the
          applicability of mandatory provisions, in particular of the state in which you have your habitual residence as
          a consumer, remain unaffected.</p>
        <p>9.2. Should individual provisions of these Terms and Conditions be or become invalid, this shall not affect
          the validity of the remaining provisions.</p>
        <p>9.3. If the customer is a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, the
          place
          of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from contractual relationships between the customer and BTE is the
          registered office of BTE.</p>
        <p>9.4. The EU Commission has created an internet platform for the online settlement of disputes. The platform
          serves
          as a contact point for the out-of-court settlement of disputes concerning contractual obligations arising from
          online purchase contracts.
